> During my time working with the guys at The-Dot, we proposed this
> concept to Channel 4, the brief was to create a brand and channel
> that would appeal to the 40+ market. Since then they phased out
> this plan and have introduced 4seven instead.

> We proposed this teaser trailer to make the public aware of the new
> experience that we'd be creating with some sneaky peaks of the new
> content they'd be getting access to.

> To keep a consistent brand identity show trailers would be tailored
> with stylised overlays which would re-enforce the brand to make it
> more recognisable and help viewers identify specific shows with the channel.

> Finally we'd created some TV stings examples which can be
> dropped during the adverts to advertise new content.
