> As a part of the <a href="https://www.selesti.com" target="_blank">Selesti</a> team, we designed and developed

> funded project helping children suffering from bereavement by
> providing them with a secure platform to express their feelings and
> participate in mini-games to help ease their pain.

### BBC Children in Need TV Slot
> Recently Nelsons Journey gained lots of media attention as it was featured on
> TV with a small segment talking with children about how the app has
> helped them overcome issues.

### The app has 5 main aims:

* To help increase the self-esteem of bereaved children and young people
* To allow bereaved children and young people to express their feelings and understand their emotions
* Provide opportunities to remember the person who has died
* Provide education about bereavement
* Help families talk more openly about their bereavement

### Virtual coping strategies
> The app aims to mirror activities that Nelson Journey deliver offline to help children deal with bereavement. It offers a virtual version of:

* a diary to log how they are feeling
* a jar to collect memories of their lost loved one
* a balloon release ceremony as a symbol of letting go of negative feelings of grief
* advice and support whatever the time or situation
