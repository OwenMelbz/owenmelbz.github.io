> One of my first iPad application projects at <a href="https://www.selesti.com" target="_blank">Selesti</a> involved
> creating a platform which would allow models to
> able to take their Sandra Reynolds portfolios
> to castings without requiring internet access, as well as allowing
> the app to double up as a short-listing platform so businesses
> can easily locally save their favourite prospects to a short-list.

> The application itself was a clean simple design allowing the
> content to do the talking with a minimal interfact to browse categories
> when looking for models, or by using the search to find yourself.

> Once the users have found the desired profile, they are presented with
> information about the model and the ability to save them. The user can then
> swipe through the models photos.

> The app has been available to download since 2014 and has since helped over 100 models
> to take their portfolio around the country with them and has received great feedback.
